56,Blue Moon,"Reacher is on a Greyhound bus, minding his own business, with no particular place to go, and all the time in the world to get there. Then he steps off the bus to help an old man who is obviously just a victim waiting to happen. But you know what they say about good deeds. Now Reacher wants to make it right. An elderly couple have made a few well-meaning mistakes, and now they owe big money to some very bad people. One brazen move leads to another, and suddenly Reacher finds himself a wanted man in the middle of a brutal turf war between rival Ukrainian and Albanian gangs. Reacher has to stay one step ahead of the loan sharks, the thugs, and the assassins. He teams up with a fed-up waitress who knows a little more than she's letting on, and sets out to take down the powerful and make the greedy pay. It's a long shot. The odds are against him. But Reacher believes in a certain kind of justice...the kind that comes along once in a blue moon.",http://books.google.com/books/content?id=V1zaDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,Crime-Thriller
72,Drink Progressively,"DRINK PROGRESSIVELY offers readers an easy and enjoyable way to find wines they love and expert advice on how to successfully pair them with their favorites dishes. Based on the trademarked method of The Urban Grape, a wildly popular wine store based in Boston, MA that utilizes Progressive Shelving, Drink Progressively offers a unique approach to identifying wines by their weight and body, rather than varietal or region. This revolutionary method of drinking progressively encourages readers to explore regions, producers, varietals, and price points all while staying in the comfort zone of their wine palate. (Imagine correlating the wine to skim milk, whole milk, and heavy cream. The body of a Pinot Grigio is more like that of skim milk while a heavy-oaked Chardonney has a mouth feel more reminiscent of heavy cream.) Drink Progressively also includes 50 delicious recipes meticulously crafted by nationally acclaimed Chef Gabriel Frasca. Frasca has worked side by side (and sip by sip) with the authors in order to create delicious dishes that are easy to prepare - and pair! Drink Progressively even includes pairings for nights when cooking is the farthest thing from your mind, but a glass of wine isn't. With suggestions for everything from takeout favorites like chicken tikka masala and falafel to pantry snacks like popcorn or chips, Drink Progressively is truly a book for everyone, from wine connoisseur to casual drinker.",http://books.google.com/books/content?id=0Zo2MQAACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api,Food-Drink
