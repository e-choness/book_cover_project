Edwards combines a sense of the historical development of photography with an insightful analysis of its purpose and meaning within a wider cultural context.,Art-Photography
1,"Susan Sontag's On Photography is a seminal and groundbreaking work on the subject. Susan Sontag's groundbreaking critique of photography asks forceful questions about the moral and aesthetic issues surrounding this art form. Photographs are everywhere, and the 'insatiability of the photographing eye' has profoundly altered our relationship with the world. Photographs have the power to shock, idealize or seduce, they create a sense of nostalgia and act as a memorial, and they can be used as evidence against us or to identify us. In these six incisive essays, Sontag examines the ways in which we use these omnipresent images to manufacture a sense of reality and authority in our lives. 'Sontag offers enough food for thought to satisfy the most intellectual of appetites'The Times 'A brilliant analysis of the profound changes photographic images have made in our way of looking at the world, and at ourselves'Washington Post 'The most original and illuminating study of the subject'New Yorker One of America's best-known and most admired writers, Susan Sontag was also a leading commentator on contemporary culture until her death in December 2004. Her books include four novels and numerous works of non-fiction, among them Regarding the Pain of Others, On Photography, Illness as Metaphor, At the Same Time, Against Interpretation and Other Essays and Reborn: Early Diaries 1947-1963, all of which are published by Penguin. A further eight books, including the collections of essays Under the Sign of Saturn and Where the Stress Falls, and the novels The Volcano Lover and The Benefactor, are available from Penguin Modern Classics.",Art-Photography
2,"Contemporary Photography and Theory offers an essential overview of some of the key critical debates in fine art photography today. Building on a foundational understanding of photography, it offers an in-depth discussion of five topic areas: identity, landscape and place, the politics of representation, psychoanalysis and the event. Written in an accessible style, it introduces the critical literature relevant to photography that has emerged over recent decades. Moving beyond seminal works by writers such as Walter Benjamin, Roland Barthes, and Susan Sontag, it enables readers to explore an extended canon of theorists including Jacques Lacan, Judith Butler and Giorgio Agamben. The book is illustrated throughout and analyses a range of works by established and emergent artists in order to show how these theoretical concepts are central to understanding contemporary photography. These 15 short essays encourage readers to apply critical thinking to both their own work and that of others. They are the perfect starting point for essays as well being of suitable length for assigned readings, making this the ideal resource for learning about contemporary photography and theory.",Art-Photography
3,"Art and Photography is the first book of its kind to survey the presence of photography in artistic practice from the 1960s onwards. The photographic image is central to contemporary art and the debates that surround it, yet it took most of the last century for it to acquire this status. Despite the extensive exploration of photography as an independent art in the Modernist era, it was not until the late twentieth century that artists, museums and galleries began to explore its social roles as a medium of representation. This volume provides a comprehensive survey of photography's place in recent art history, further contextualized in the Documents section by original artists' statements and interviews, together with critical and theoretical reflections on the photographic and the art of the photograph.",Art-Photography

6,"In the last decade, interest in photography has exploded. Among the most compelling and popular art forms, photography is now recognized as central to the development of modern and contemporary art. In this accessibly written survey, art photography comes alive through a series of frames--from documentary style and pictorialism to archives, narratives, and the conceptual uses of the medium. David Bate traces major developments and themes from the earliest days of photography, in the 1830s, to the present day, examining the many ways in which photography and art have intersected since the birth of the medium. Featuring works from a wide and international group of artists--including Henry Fox Talbot, Roger Fenton, Lee Miller, Brassaï, Robert Frank, Nan Goldin, Ed Ruscha, and Gillian Wearing--this comprehensive volume uncovers the Anglo-American and European contexts of art photography, as well as the Asian, African, and Middle Eastern perspectives.",Art-Photography

11,"The story of Giannis Antetokounmpo's extraordinary rise from poverty in Athens, Greece to super-stardom in America with the Milwaukee Bucks--becoming one of the most transcendent players in NBA history--from award-winning basketball reporter and feature writer at The Ringer Mirin Fader, touching on universal themes of family, immigration, hard work, wealth, loss, and dreaming big. As the face of the NBA's new world order, Giannis Antetokounmpo has overcome unfathomable obstacles to become a symbol of hope for people all over the world, the personification of the American Dream. But his backstory remains largely untold, and Fader unearths new information about the childhood that shaped ""The Greek Freak""--from sleeping side by side with his brothers to selling trinkets on the side of the street with his family to the racism he experienced in Greece. Antetokounmpo grew up in an era when Golden Dawn, Greek's far-right, anti-immigrant party, patrolled his neighborhood, and his status as an illegal immigrant largely prevented him from playing for Greek's top clubs, making his rise to the NBA all the more improbable. Fader tells a deeply-human story of how an unknown, skinny, Black-Greek teen, who played in the country's lowest pro division and was seen as a draft gamble, transformed his body and his game into MVP material. Antetokounmpo's story has been framed as a feel-good narrative in which the globe has embraced him, watching him grow up and lead the underdog Bucks to the best record in the NBA in 2020. Giannis reveals a more nuanced story: how hesitant Antetokounmpo was, and still is, to spend money; how lonely and isolated he felt, adjusting to America and the NBA early in his career; the way he changed after his father recently died of a heart attack; the complexity of grappling with his Black and Greek identities; how private he is, so hard on himself and his shortcomings, a drive that fuels him every day; and the deep-rooted responsibility he feels to be a nurturing role model for his younger brothers. Fader illustrates a more vulnerable star than people know, a person who has evolved triumphantly into all of his roles: as father, brother, son, teammate, and global icon. Giannis gives readers a front-row seat as Antetokounmpo strives for an elusive championship with the Bucks, and as he contends with his next big hurdle: to stay in Milwaukee or chase the possibility of NBA super-stardom with a major-market franchise.",Biography

13,"A biography of Thomas Sowell, one of America's most influential conservative thinkers Thomas Sowell is one of the great social theorists of our age. In a career spanning more than a half century, he has written over thirty books, covering topics from economic history and social inequality to political theory, race, and culture. His bold and unsentimental assaults on liberal orthodoxy have endeared him to many readers but have also enraged fellow intellectuals, the civil-rights establishment, and much of the mainstream media. The result has been a lack of acknowledgment of his scholarship among critics who prioritize political correctness. In the first-ever biography of Sowell, Jason Riley gives this iconic thinker his due and responds to the detractors. Maverick showcases Sowell's most significant writings and traces the life events that shaped his ideas and resulted in a Black orphan from the Jim Crow South becoming one of our foremost public intellectuals.",Biography

Isolated from both the war and civilization, they lead a spare existence, marked by the fierceness of the Siberian taiga, the whims of their Russian hosts, the competitiveness of fellow inmates, and sometimes, by life-sustaining windfalls.

72,"DRINK PROGRESSIVELY offers readers an easy and enjoyable way to find wines they love and expert advice on how to successfully pair them with their favorites dishes. Based on the trademarked method of The Urban Grape, a wildly popular wine store based in Boston, MA that utilizes Progressive Shelving, Drink Progressively offers a unique approach to identifying wines by their weight and body, rather than varietal or region. This revolutionary method of drinking progressively encourages readers to explore regions, producers, varietals, and price points all while staying in the comfort zone of their wine palate. (Imagine correlating the wine to skim milk, whole milk, and heavy cream. The body of a Pinot Grigio is more like that of skim milk while a heavy-oaked Chardonney has a mouth feel more reminiscent of heavy cream.) Drink Progressively also includes 50 delicious recipes meticulously crafted by nationally acclaimed Chef Gabriel Frasca. Frasca has worked side by side (and sip by sip) with the authors in order to create delicious dishes that are easy to prepare - and pair! Drink Progressively even includes pairings for nights when cooking is the farthest thing from your mind, but a glass of wine isn't. With suggestions for everything from takeout favorites like chicken tikka masala and falafel to pantry snacks like popcorn or chips, Drink Progressively is truly a book for everyone, from wine connoisseur to casual drinker.",Food-Drink
73,"Scholars across the humanities and social sciences are increasingly examining the importance of consumption to changing notions of local, regional, national and supranational identity in Europe. As part of this interest, anthropologists, historians, sociologists and others have paid particular attention to the roles which food and drink have played in the construction of local, regional and national identity in Europe. This volume provides the first multidisciplinary look at the contributions which food and alcohol make to contemporary European identities, including the part they play in processes of European integration and Europeanization. It provides theoretically informed ethnographic and historical case studies of transformations and continuity in social and cultural patterns in the production and consumption of European foods and drinks, in order to explore how eating and drinking have helped to construct various local, regional and national identities in Europe. Of particular note in this volume is its attention to how food and drink intersect with recent attempts to foster greater European integration, in part through the recognition and support of common and diverse European cultures and identities.",Food-Drink

John Ayto spreads across our table a veritable cornucopia, from common fruits and vegetables (apples, cherries, apricots, and broccoli, to name a few), to exotic foreign dishes such as gado-gado, nasi goreng, satay, and dashi, and even junk foods such as doughnuts, brownies, and candy.

In addition, Ayto has expanded the coverage of vocabulary from foreign cuisines, such as Thai, Korean, Vietnamese, and parts of South America. Throughout, Ayto provides fascinating capsule histories of the various foods. He tells us, for instance, that cantaloupe was introduced into Europe from Armenia and was apparently first cultivated at Cantaluppi, a former summer estate of the popes near Rome.

101,"This open access peer-reviewed volume was inspired by the UNESCO UNITWIN Network for Underwater Archaeology International Workshop held at Flinders University, Adelaide, Australia in November 2016. Content is based on, but not limited to, the work presented at the workshop which was dedicated to 3D recording and interpretation for maritime archaeology. The volume consists of contributions from leading international experts as well as up-and-coming early career researchers from around the globe. The content of the book includes recording and analysis of maritime archaeology through emerging technologies, including both practical and theoretical contributions. Topics include photogrammetric recording, laser scanning, marine geophysical 3D survey techniques, virtual reality, 3D modelling and reconstruction, data integration and Geographic Information Systems. The principal incentive for this publication is the ongoing rapid shift in the methodologies of maritime archaeology within recent years and a marked increase in the use of 3D and digital approaches. This convergence of digital technologies such as underwater photography and photogrammetry, 3D sonar, 3D virtual reality, and 3D printing has highlighted a pressing need for these new methodologies to be considered together, both in terms of defining the state-of-the-art and for consideration of future directions. As a scholarly publication, the audience for the book includes students and researchers, as well as professionals working in various aspects of archaeology, heritage management, education, museums, and public policy. It will be of special interest to those working in the field of coastal cultural resource management and underwater archaeology but will also be of broader interest to anyone interested in archaeology and to those in other disciplines who are now engaging with 3D recording and visualization.",History-Archaeology

124,"""Psychological trauma can be a life-changing experience that affects multiple facets of health and well-being. The nature of trauma is to impact the mind and body in unpredictable and multidimensional ways. It can be a highly subjective that is difficult or even impossible to explain with words. It also can impact the body in highly individualized ways and result in complex symptoms that affect memory, social engagement, and quality of life. While many people overcome trauma with resilience and without long term effects, many do not. Trauma's impact often requires approaches that address the sensory-based experiences many survivors report. The expressive arts therapy-the purposeful application of art, music, dance/movement, dramatic enactment, creative writing and imaginative play-are largely non-verbal ways of self-expression of feelings and perceptions. More importantly, they are action-oriented and tap implicit, embodied experiences of trauma that can defy expression through verbal therapy or logic. Based on current evidence-based and emerging brain-body practices, there are eight key reasons for including expressive arts in trauma intervention, covered in this book: (1) letting the senses tell the story; (2) self-soothing mind and body; (3) engaging the body; (4) enhancing nonverbal communication; (5) recovering self-efficacy; (6) rescripting the trauma story; (7) making meaning; and (8) restoring aliveness""--",Medical
125,"Forbidden Knowledge explores the censorship of medical books from their proliferation in print through the prohibitions placed on them during the Counter-Reformation. How and why did books banned in Italy in the sixteenth century end up back on library shelves in the seventeenth? Historian Hannah Marcus uncovers how early modern physicians evaluated the utility of banned books and facilitated their continued circulation in conversation with Catholic authorities. Through extensive archival research, Marcus highlights how talk of scientific utility, once thought to have begun during the Scientific Revolution, in fact began earlier, emerging from ecclesiastical censorship and the desire to continue to use banned medical books. What’s more, this censorship in medicine, which preceded the Copernican debate in astronomy by sixty years, has had a lasting impact on how we talk about new and controversial developments in scientific knowledge. Beautiful illustrations accompany this masterful, timely book about the interplay between efforts at intellectual control and the utility of knowledge.",Medical

127,"Diet Books: Anti Inflammatory Foods and Detox Recipes Have you gotten tired of being on diet after diet without losing weight or experiencing better health? This book is designed to help you fight the problems associated with most diet and weight loss plans while improving your overall health and wellbeing. The world is full of dieting books for people interested in weight loss, but many of them don't support good health. They focus only on getting rid of the weight and not on making sure your body stays in good condition. That can cause real problems later on, when you see yourself losing muscle mass, or when you continue to suffer from the tiredness and other problems brought on by toxic, inflammatory foods. Conventional diet books pay attention to factors like fat content, carbohydrate levels, or calorie percentages. These are all an important part of successful dieting, but they're not sufficient to help you lose weight and reclaim your health. That's because these diet cookbooks ignore the role of toxins and inflammation in weight gain and physical problems. This book provides the recipes and resources you need to get your systems back under your control and start taking off unhealthy fat. You'll enjoy great meals featuring fruit smoothies, crisp salads, risottos and homemade chips and dips. You'll also get the chance to try out anti-inflammatory foods based on lean protein and plenty of health-boosting fresh vegetables. These foods are designed to support good health without losing out on flavor. Once you've tried them, you'll never go back to the way you used to eat. Great health and a beautiful body are compatible goals. You just need to choose a diet that includes beneficial foods.

This book contains a collection of conference contributions on service sector reforms from members of academic institutions, ministries, the EU Commission and other organisations. The conference consisted of a keynote on the importance and implementation of structural reforms in Europe and two panels that dealt with the evaluation of past reforms in the services sector and the potential scope and effects of further reforms. Since the 1990s, productivity growth in Germany and other Member States of the European Union has been significantly lower than in the US. The development of productivity growth in the services sector is estimated to account for two thirds of this widening gap. The European Commission advocated reforms in the services sector in its country-specific recommendations for Germany. At a conference in Berlin in July 2016, experts from various fields presented and discussed studies on service sector reforms.",Personal-Development

164,"Diet Books: Anti Inflammatory Foods and Detox Recipes Have you gotten tired of being on diet after diet without losing weight or experiencing better health? This book is designed to help you fight the problems associated with most diet and weight loss plans while improving your overall health and wellbeing. The world is full of dieting books for people interested in weight loss, but many of them don't support good health. They focus only on getting rid of the weight and not on making sure your body stays in good condition. That can cause real problems later on, when you see yourself losing muscle mass, or when you continue to suffer from the tiredness and other problems brought on by toxic, inflammatory foods. Conventional diet books pay attention to factors like fat content, carbohydrate levels, or calorie percentages. These are all an important part of successful dieting, but they're not sufficient to help you lose weight and reclaim your health. That's because these diet cookbooks ignore the role of toxins and inflammation in weight gain and physical problems. This book provides the recipes and resources you need to get your systems back under your control and start taking off unhealthy fat. You'll enjoy great meals featuring fruit smoothies, crisp salads, risottos and homemade chips and dips. You'll also get the chance to try out anti-inflammatory foods based on lean protein and plenty of health-boosting fresh vegetables. These foods are designed to support good health without losing out on flavor. Once you've tried them, you'll never go back to the way you used to eat. Great health and a beautiful body are compatible goals. You just need to choose a diet that includes beneficial foods. Decrease toxin and inflammation levels, slim down, and boost your health by enjoying these simple recipes. It won't take long until you're amazed that you ever ate any other way.",Reference

172,"Warning: The Books of Simion are the most Profound books of knowledge that have ever been delivered to the Gentile nations. The Books of Simion are written for kings and all in authority only so kings and all in authority can determine what is best for the people. The Books of Simion are the books of records that are referred to as the books of remembrance that are written for kings and all in authority so kings and all in authority are not dishonored and their kingdoms are not destroyed by deceptions (Ezra 4:14–15 and Malachi 3:16). The Books of Simion are the translation of the Holy Bible and the ancient scriptures by those who are scattered, whose ancestors were slaves and persecuted in Egypt for 430 years. Later in the latter days, ascendants were taken to a foreign land named America on ships in bondage and held there as slaves and persecuted for 430 years that the Holy Bible has identified as God’s chosen people and God’s firstborn. There is no other interpretation and translation of the Holy Bible and the end-time prophesies of the God of Abraham by any other race of people on the planet earth that is better(Genesis 15:13–14, Acts 7:6–7, Deuteronomy 28:68, Jeremiah 30:3, Jeremiah 30:18, Luke 21:24, John 11:52, Joel 3:1, and Exodus 4:22). The Books of Simion will connect all of the dots or events in history together with the Holy Bible and the ancient scriptures to bring events and scriptures together, to make sense of what happened in our past, to understand what is happening in our present, and to determine what will happen in the future. The readers will learn more about the Holy Bible, God and the devil, the extraterrestrials, the old black African dominion, and the new white Gentile dominion from the Books of Simion than they have learned and understood from the combined books and learning institutions they have been exposed to all of the their lives. For the first time in the readers’ lives, they will understand what they could never understand before. Without the Books of Simion, the readers will go from university to university constantly learning but never able to come to the knowledge of the truth (2 Timothy 3:7). All of the great secrets, including the mystery of the gospel, have been revealed in the Books of Simion. Because the world was started over to give the Gentiles a second chance for salvation in the world we live in today, the final outcome from all of our actions and choices of today will be revealed, as well as what we all must do to inherit the earth. Absolutely nothing is more important than knowing the final outcome from last time before we make our final choices this time. Prepare yourself.",Religion
173,"THE SUNDAY TIMES TOP 10 BESTSELLER AND THE FIRST AUTHORITATIVE ACCOUNT FOR 30 YEARS. 'By far the clearest book ever written about the Holocaust, and also the best at explaining its origins and grotesque mentality, as well as its chaotic development' Antony Beevor 'Groundbreaking. You might have thought that we know everything there is to know about the Holocaust but this book proves there is much more' Andrew Roberts, Mail on Sunday Two fundamental questions about the Holocaust must be answered: How did it happen? And why? More completely than any other single work of history yet published, Laurence Rees's Holocaust definitively answers them. 'With The Holocaust Rees has set himself the task of writing an accessible chronological account of the murder of six million Jews in conditions of scarcely imaginable horror. He's done it excellently. There is no shortage of books on the Holocaust but Rees's stands out as a readable and authoritative exposition of how and why it happened, and the barbarous methods by which it was pursued. The amount of ground it covers in 500 pages is remarkable - from the anti-Semitism of popular German literature of the 19th century to Hitler's suicide and the surrender of his regime. It's excellently written and skilfully interweaves narrative history, sound interpretation and the recollections (through interviews, listed in the notes as ""previously unpublished testimony"") of survivors. Rees provides an exemplary account of how the greatest crime in modern history came about' The Times 'Rees has distilled 25 years of research into this compelling study, the finest single-volume account of the Holocaust. It is not a book for the faint-hearted. Some of the first-hand testimony is both shocking and heart-rending. Yet it has important things to say about human nature - what our species is capable of doing if not prevented by civilized laws - and demands to be read' Saul David, Telegraph 'Anyone wanting a compelling, highly readable explanation of how and why the Holocaust happened, drawing on recent scholarship and impressively incorporating moving and harrowing interviews need look no further than Laurence Rees's brilliant book' Professor Ian Kershaw, bestselling author of Hitler",Religion

175,"If Darwin were to examine the evidence today using modern science, would his conclusions be the same? Charles Darwin’s On the Origin of Species, published over 150 years ago, is considered one of history’s most influential books and continues to serve as the foundation of thought for evolutionary biology. Since Darwin’s time, however, new fields of science have immerged that simply give us better answers to the question of origins. With a Ph.D. in cell and developmental biology from Harvard University, Dr. Nathaniel Jeanson is uniquely qualified to investigate what genetics reveal about origins. The Origins Puzzle Comes Together If the science surrounding origins were a puzzle, Darwin would have had fewer than 15% of the pieces to work with when he developed his theory of evolution. We now have a much greater percentage of the pieces because of modern scientific research. As Dr. Jeanson puts the new pieces together, a whole new picture emerges, giving us a testable, predictive model to explain the origin of species. A New Scientific Revolution Begins Darwin’s theory of evolution may be one of science’s “sacred cows,” but genetics research is proving it wrong. Changing an entrenched narrative, even if it’s wrong, is no easy task. Replacing Darwin asks you to consider the possibility that, based on genetics research, our origins are more easily understood in the context of . . . In the beginning . . . God, with the timeline found in the biblical narrative of Genesis. There is a better answer to the origins debate than what we have been led to believe. Let the revolution begin!",Religion

The idea of the world as a sphere had been widely accepted in scientific, philosophical and even religious circles from as early as the fourth century bc. Bizarrely, it was not until the supposedly more rational nineteenth century that the notion that the world might actually be flat really took hold. Even more bizarrely, it persists to this day. Based on a range of original sources, Garwood's history of flat-earth beliefs - from the Babylonians to the present day - raises issues central to the history and philosophy of science, its relationship with religion and the making of human knowledge about the natural world.

The complicated and often ambiguous relationship between food and horror draws important and inescapable connections to matters of disgust, hunger, abjection, violence, as well as the sensationalisation of transgressive corporeality and monstrous pleasures. By looking at food consumption within Gothic cinema, the book uncovers eating as a metaphorical activity of the self, where the haunting psychology of the everyday, the porous boundaries of the body, and the uncanny limits of consumer identity collide. Aimed at scholars, researchers, and students of the field, Consuming Gothic charts different manifestations of food and horror in film while identifying specific socio-political and cultural anxieties of contemporary life.",Science-Fiction-Fantasy-Horror

In this work, which for the first time described the geography of the entire inhabited world as it was then known, Eratosthenes of Kyrene (ca. 285-205 BC) invented the discipline of geography as we understand it. A polymath who served as librarian at Alexandria and tutor to the future King Ptolemy IV, Eratosthenes created the terminology of geography, probably including the word geographia itself. Building on his previous work, in which he determined the size and shape of the earth, Eratosthenes in the Geographika created a grid of parallels and meridians that linked together every place in the world: for the first time one could figure out the relationship and distance between remote localities, such as northwest Africa and the Caspian Sea. The Geographika also identified some four hundred places, more than ever before, from Thoule (probably Iceland) to Taprobane (Sri Lanka), and from well down the coast of Africa to Central Asia. This is the first collation of the more than 150 fragments of the Geographika in more than a century. Each fragment is accompanied by an English translation, a summary, and commentary. Duane W. Roller provides a rich background, including a history of the text and its reception, a biography of Eratosthenes, and a comprehensive account of ancient Greek geographical thought and of Eratosthenes' pioneering contribution to it. This edition also includes maps that show all of the known places named in the Geographika, appendixes, a bibliography, and indexes.",Science-Geography
201,"Ptolemy's Geography is the only book on cartography to have survived from the classical period and one of the most influential scientific works of all time. Written in the second century AD, for more than fifteen centuries it was the most detailed topography of Europe and Asia available and the best reference on how to gather data and draw maps. Ptolemy championed the use of astronomical observation and applied mathematics in determining geographical locations. But more importantly, he introduced the practice of writing down coordinates of latitude and longitude for every feature drawn on a world map, so that someone else possessing only the text of the Geography could reproduce Ptolemy's map at any time, in whole or in part, at any scale. Here Berggren and Jones render an exemplary translation of the Geography and provide a thorough introduction, which treats the historical and technical background of Ptolemy's work, the contents of the Geography, and the later history of the work.",Science-Geography

239,"This volume identifies, discusses and addresses the wide array of ethical issues that have emerged for engineers due to the rise of a global economy. To date, there has been no systematic treatment of the particular challenges globalization poses for engineering ethics standards and education. This volume concentrates on precisely this challenge. Scholars and practitioners from diverse national and professional backgrounds discuss the ethical issues emerging from the inherent symbiotic relationship between the engineering profession and globalization. Through their discussions a deeper and more complete understanding of the precise ways in which globalization impacts the formulation and justification of ethical standards in engineering as well as the curriculum and pedagogy of engineering ethics education emerges. The world today is witnessing an unprecedented demand for engineers and other science and technology professionals with advanced degrees due to both the off-shoring of western jobs and the rapid development of non-Western countries. The current flow of technology and professionals is from the West to the rest of the world. Professional practices followed by Western (or Western-trained) engineers are often based on presuppositions which can be in fundamental disagreement with the viewpoints of non-Westerners. A successful engineering solution cannot be simply technically sound, but also must account for cultural, social and religious constraints. For these reasons, existing Western standards cannot simply be exported to other countries. Divided into two parts, Part I of the volume provides an overview of particular dimensions of globalization and the criteria that an adequate engineering ethics framework must satisfy in a globalized world. Part II of the volume considers pedagogical challenges and aims in engineering ethics education that is global in character.",Technology-Engineering
